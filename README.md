## Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm a Data Engineer with 6+ years of experience, currently working in a fintech industry.
- ✍ I've done my Masters in Computer Science and Machine Learning from George Mason University, Virginia.
- 🏂 I'm currently building a scalable and robust multi-cloud data infrastructure on healthcare dataset.
- 🔍 I've a strong interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I've built a BERT model for sentence classification. And I've also worked on a research paper to implement a cost-effective solution for Natural Language Understanding of long texts that can utilize pre-trained encoder-decoder models designed for short texts.
- 🔧 As a believer in the DevOps ethos, I include agile DevOps methods into my data engineering workflows and I am still learning the best practices. 
- 🎯 My goal is to contribute to open-source projects and become a data architect.
